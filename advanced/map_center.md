The center of a map is important to how a map plays, since the center is usually the best area to control. Some maps have weak centers while others have strong centers. If the center of a map is too weak, players will mostly ignore the center and commit their forces elsewhere. If the center of a map is too strong, players will send all of their forces to the center while mostly ignoring the sides. There are many ways to weaken or strengthen the center of your map.

### Making The Center Stronger
- Add more heavy terrain to the center
- Add more properties to the center
- Move the HQs near the center
- Make it easier to frontswitch from the center

### Making The Center Weaker
- Reduce the amount of heavy terrain in the center
- Reduce the number of properties in the center
- Move the HQs away from the center
- Make it harder to frontswitch from the center
