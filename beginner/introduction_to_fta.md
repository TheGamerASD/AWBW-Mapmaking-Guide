### What is FTA?
FTA is a commonly used acronym which means first turn advantage. First turn advantage refers to the advantage that the player who moves first has in a match of Advance Wars. Because the first player moves first, they are able to do things like reach contested properties first or move on to contested high defense terrain before their opponent can.

### FTA Counters
There are a variety of different FTA counters for different situations. Here I will list the FTA counters for the most common types of maps.

#### 2 Bases Per Side (Standard/Fog of War)
Both bases should be preowned. The second player should have a predeployed infantry on the strongest base. The strongest base is the one with the most properties near it.

#### 3 Bases Per Side (Standard/Fog of War)
2 bases should be preowned. One of the bases should be neutral. The second player should have a predeployed infantry on the preowned base closest to the neutral base. It is important to make sure that the capture of a neutral base cannot be interrupted by the other player.
