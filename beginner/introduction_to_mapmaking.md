### Map Size
When you're creating a map, the first thing you need to consider is the size of the map.
Maps which are around 15x15 in size are considered small. It is recommended to not go below 15x15, because overly small maps usually tend to stall out. Maps which are around 20x20 in size are considered medium sized, and most maps are around 20x20. Large maps are around 25x25 or larger.

### Map Symmetry
Once you enter the map editor, you will have the option of choosing a symmetry.

It is recommended to use Rotate 2Q, because it allows for more dynamic maps that are still symmetrical. It is not recommended to make an asymmetrical map, because it is extremely difficult to make a competitively viable and balanced map that isn't symmetrical.

### Map Bases
Most competitive maps have 2 or 3 bases per side. A map with 2 bases per side is considered base light. Having too many bases causes infantry or mech spam which can make the map stall out. Some maps which are mixed base also have 4 bases per side.

Additionally, you should avoid having contested neutral bases. Having contested neutral bases means that whoever wins the neutral bases gets a huge advantage over their opponent, so players will focus their entire army on the neutral bases. 

### HQ Placement

Most maps in the Advance Wars console games placed the HQ right next to or behind the bases. The problem with this is that it becomes very difficult for your opponent to capture your HQ when it's protected by your bases, which causes games to drag on even when one player has clearly won.

In Advance Wars By Web, most maps place the HQ in front of the bases. If one player starts losing enough to where they aren't able to protect their HQ, their opponent can capture their HQ to end the game. It is recommended to place the HQ so that it takes 2 turns for a tank to be able to attack a unit on the HQ from the nearest allied base.
