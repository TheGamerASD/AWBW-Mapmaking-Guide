### Map Size
When you're creating a map, the first thing you need to consider is the size of the map.
Maps which are around 15x15 in size are considered small. It is recommended to not go below 15x15, because overly small maps usually tend to stall out. Maps which are around 20x20 in size are considered medium sized, and most maps are around 20x20. Large maps are around 25x25 or larger.

### Map Bases
Most competitive maps have 2 or 3 bases per side. A map with 2 bases per side is considered base light. Having a single base per side causes there to be not enough infantry, while having too many bases causes infantry or mech spam. Some mixed base maps also have 4 bases per side.

Additionaly, you should avoid having contested neutral bases. Having contested neutral bases means that whoever wins the neutral bases gets a huge advantage over their opponent, so players will focus their entire army on the neutral bases.
