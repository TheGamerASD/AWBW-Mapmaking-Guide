### Map Size
When you're creating a map, the first thing you need to consider is the size of the map.
Maps which are around 15x15 in size are considered small. It is recommended to not go below 15x15, because overly small maps usually tend to stall out. Maps which are around 20x20 in size are considered medium sized, and most maps are around 20x20. Large maps are around 25x25 or larger.

### Map Symmetry
Once you enter the map editor, you will have the option of choosing a symmetry.

It is recommended to use Rotate 2Q, because it allows for more dynamic maps that are still symmetrical. You could also try making an asymmetrical map, though it is extremely difficult to make a competitively viable map that isn't symmetrical.

### Map Bases
Most competitive maps have 2 or 3 bases per side. A map with 2 bases per side is considered base light. Having too many bases causes infantry or mech spam which can make the map stall out. Some mixed base maps also have 4 bases per side.

Additionally, you should avoid having contested neutral bases. Having contested neutral bases means that whoever wins the neutral bases gets a huge advantage over their opponent, so players will focus their entire army on the neutral bases. 

### Map Terrain
Plains are the most common terrain type in most maps. They have 1 defense star and have 1 movement cost for all units except for units with wheels, which have 2 movement cost on them.

Forests are a terrain type which have 2 defense stars. They have a movement cost of 2 for units with treads and a movement cost of 3 for units with wheels. Forests are good for slowing down vehicles but not infantry.

Cities are an important terrain type because they not only have 3 defense stars, but they also give income to the player who owns them. You should make sure not to place too many cities close to each other as this can make it hard to attack into that area. While placing cities, you should keep in mind that infantry units can move 3 spaces per turn, so don't place too many cities within 3 spaces of each other.

Roads and shoals have 1 movement cost for all units, but they have no defense stars. They should be placed for helping wheeled units get around or for making it easier to attack into a tile.

Mountains and rivers are impassable by vehicles, so only infantry, mech, and air units can get over them. Only infantry units are slowed down by these tiles. Mountains and rivers are useful for shaping where battles will take place since vehicles will be unable to cross them. The difference between rivers and mountains is that rivers have no defense stars while mountains have 4 defense stars.
