Advance Wars offers a lot of options when making a map, though not all of them are good for competitive play. Here is a list of things you should avoid doing when making a competitive map on AWBW.

### Preowned Properties
Too many preowned properties causes FTA. You should avoid placing more than 3 preowned properties which give income per player, except for properties used to counter FTA.

### Predeployed Units
Aside from predeployed units used for countering FTA, predeployed units usually cause FTA, since player one will be able to move them before player 2. Predeployed transports are usually fine, and so are predeployed units which are trapped inside a small space.

### Close Bases
You should make sure not to place bases too close to each other, as this can lead to FTA. It also makes for a less interesting battle since destroyed units are replaced quickly.
