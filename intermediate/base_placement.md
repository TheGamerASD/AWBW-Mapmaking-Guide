When making a map, base placement is important since land units, which make up most of your army, are built on bases. In this guide, you will learn how
to place bases in good locations in your AWBW map.

### Base Distance

If bases of different countries are too close to each other, it can cause FTA or STA since one player can move their first tank out and zone out the other player. Opposing bases being too close usually also lead to uninteresting battles, since destroyed units are replaced quickly.

### Base Importance

If one base can deploy units to the front lines faster than another base, players might choose to build vehicles only on that base while only building infantry on the other bases.
To increase player choice, bases should be roughly equal in importance. Additionally, if one base has many more properties near it than another base, it can cause turn advantage since the normal FTA counter might give one player too much of an advantage.

### Other Considerations

You should also make sure that a base can't be easily artillery or rocket locked from a tile which is hard to attack. In addition, bases shouldn't be placed too evenly across a map, as it can lead to the map stalling.

The bases in this map are evenly spread out which could cause the map to stall.<br>
