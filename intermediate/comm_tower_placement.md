Comm. towers are a property which are seen on most competitive maps. They give the owner 10% extra attack power on all of their units.
Most maps have comm. towers because they make the map less likely to stall by giving both players a small damage boost.


Some maps have 2 comm. towers per side instead of only one, this should be done only in limited circumstances, usually when the map has a lot of heavy terrain.
You should make sure when placing comm. towers that they are not overly contested, because that will make it easy for one player to get both towers. This means that contested central comm. towers are usually a bad idea.


Some maps have comm. towers placed in a way that they are contestable in the midgame if you are beating your opponent in that area.
You could also place the comm. towers in a location where they are uncontested, but take a few turns to reach with infantry.
