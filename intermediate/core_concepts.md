In AWBW map design, there are three core concepts which make a good map. Balance, dynamic gameplay, and player choice. Most of the guides on this site are made to help achieve one of these core concepts. Let's take a closer look into these core concepts of AWBW map design.

### Balance
Balance refers to both players in a map having an equal possibility of winning. In a balanced map, no player has an unfair advantage over the other player. Of course, making the map symmetrical solves most balance issues, but FTA is still something to be careful of.

### Dynamic Gameplay
Maps with dynamic gameplay are designed to prevent stalemates from occurring. Stalemates happen when both sides have heavily fortified their front lines with indirects and infantry, making attacking difficult. Dynamic gameplay can be encouraged by opening up fronts, lowering the amount of heavy terrain, or adding more contested cities.

##### This map is designed to prevent stalemates with more open fronts that make it possible but not too easy to defend.

### Player Choice
