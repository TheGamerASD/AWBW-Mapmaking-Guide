The amount of income each side has in a map is determined by how many cities, bases, and HQs the map has.
Too low of an income will cause infantry spam, but too high of an income will lead to barely any infantry being built after the capture phase ends.

### Income Per Base
It is recommended for there to be at least 6k + 1k/base income, as this is the minimum to build a tank and an infantry on the remaining bases each turn. 7k income per base is not recommended, as it usually leads to players building tanks on all of their bases and unable to save up funds to buy more powerful units.

### Airports and Ports
If your map has an airport in it, you should add in 3k more income, since battle copters are 2k more expensive than tanks, and since building a unit on an airport doesn't use up a base, which means players can build infantry on all of their bases. Naval units usually don't see much usage outside of high funds, so they don't need any additional income.
